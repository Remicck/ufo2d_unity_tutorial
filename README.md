## Description
This UFO Project is my Unity testing.  
I have never created 'game' with programming. Collision, Score, Flame, I don't know.  

So I started this project with the purpose of selecting Unity which is relatively low threshold for game development and seeing basic knowledge in game development.

## Demo

## Requirement
Unity5.2

## Usage
